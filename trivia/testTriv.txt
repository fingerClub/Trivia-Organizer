Let’s get into the rules for today 

At live prize trivia we have one answer per table, with no help from cellphones, iPads, or any electronics that could help you get an edge in this competition. answers are final once you turn them in. 

If you look at our trivia sheet, you will notice we have two halves with 3 rounds each . Each round has three categories with three different questions. In each round we have three different point differentials that you can wager 1, 3, and 5 with each one only allowed to be used once.  In the second half, these differentials  are increased by 1, meaning you can wager 2, 4, or 6 in that half.

We have a special halftime question and a Final question. But I will get to those when we encounter them. There is a Daily double! I will announce the daily double when I announce the categories of that round and I’ll explain the rules when we encounter that. Alright everyone let’s get started. If have been playing for a long time and notice I have made a mistake, please be eager to let me know and as soon as possible.

HALF TIME QUESTION
For the half time question, it is a four part answer, I do not give  song hints for this one. Each answer you get right, I will grant you 2 points.
